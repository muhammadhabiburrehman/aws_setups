## What is a Load Balancer?

A Load Balancer is a service that **distributes incoming network traffic** across multiple targets (like EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses) to ensure:
- **High availability** - if one server fails, traffic routes to healthy servers
- **Improved performance** - distributes load to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed
- **Scalability** - can easily add/remove servers as needed

---

## Types of Load Balancers in AWS

### 1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Layer 7** (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Best for web applications
- Supports path-based and host-based routing
- Can route to different target groups based on URL paths

### 2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- **Layer 4** (TCP/UDP)
- Ultra-high performance, low latency
- Handles millions of requests per second
- Best for gaming, IoT, or high-throughput applications

### 3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
- **Layer 3** (Network layer)
- Used for deploying, scaling, and managing third-party virtual appliances
- Common for firewalls, intrusion detection systems

### 4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**
- **Legacy** - operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7
- Not recommended for new applications
- Being phased out in favor of ALB/NLB

## Key Terminologies

### üéØ **Target**
- Individual resource that receives traffic (EC2 instance, container, IP address)
- Can be in different Availability Zones
- Must be healthy to receive traffic

### üë• **Target Group**
- Collection of targets that the load balancer routes requests to
- You define health check settings at target group level
- Can have multiple target groups per load balancer

### üëÇ **Listener**
- Process that **checks for connection requests** using protocol and port you configure
- Rules determine how the load balancer routes requests to targets
- Example: HTTP listener on port 80, HTTPS listener on port 443

### üìã **Listener Rules**
- Define **how to route incoming requests** to target groups
- Based on conditions like:
  - Host header (`api.example.com` vs `www.example.com`)
  - Path patterns (`/api/*` vs `/images/*`)
  - HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
  - Source IP addresses

## Creating Load Balancer via Console

### Prerequisites: Create EC2 Instances First

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Before creating a load balancer, you need targets to route traffic to!

#### Create EC2 Instances:

1. **Launch EC2 Instances**
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Instances
   - Click "Launch Instance"
   - **Recommended**: Create 2 or more instances for high availability

2. **Instance Configuration**
   - **AMI**: Choose appropriate AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2)
   - **Instance Type**: t2.micro or as per your needs
   - **Key Pair**: Select or create key pair for SSH access
   - **Security Group**: 
     - Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP
     - Allow HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
     - Allow HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere if using SSL

3. **Deploy Your Application**
   - SSH into each instance
   - Install and configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
   - Deploy your application code
   - **Test**: Ensure your app is accessible via instance public IP

4. **Multiple Availability Zones (Recommended)**
   - Create instances in different AZs for high availability
   - Example: 1 instance in us-east-1a, 1 instance in us-east-1b

### Step-by-Step Load Balancer Creation:

1. **Navigate to EC2 Console**
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers

2. **Create Load Balancer**
   - Click "Create Load Balancer"
   - Choose type (usually Application Load Balancer for web apps)

3. **Basic Configuration**
   - **Name**: Give your load balancer a name
   - **Scheme**: Internet-facing or Internal
   - **IP Address Type**: IPv4 or Dual stack

4. **Network Mapping**
   - **VPC**: Select your VPC
   - **Availability Zones**: Select at least 2 AZs
   - **Subnets**: Choose public subnets for internet-facing LB

5. **Security Groups**
   - Create or select security group
   - Allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)

6. **Configure Listeners**
   - **HTTP Listener**: Port 80 ‚Üí Forward to target group
   - **HTTPS Listener**: Port 443 ‚Üí Forward to target group (requires SSL certificate)

7. **Create Target Group**
   - **Target Type**: Instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions
   - **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS
   - **Port**: Application port (usually 80 or 8080)
   - **Health Check**: Configure path and settings

8. **Register Targets**
   - Select EC2 instances or other targets
   - Add to target group

9. **Review and Create**

## AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

### What is ACM?
AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily **provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates** for use with AWS services.

### Key Benefits:
- **Free SSL certificates** for AWS services
- **Automatic renewal** - no manual certificate management
- **Easy integration** with Load Balancers, CloudFront, API Gateway

### Steps to Use ACM:

1. **Request Certificate**
   - Go to Certificate Manager in AWS Console
   - Click "Request a certificate"
   - Choose "Request a public certificate"

2. **Domain Configuration**
   - Enter your domain name (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
   - Add additional domains if needed (wildcards supported: `*.yourdomain.com`)

3. **Validation Methods**
   - **DNS Validation** (recommended): Add CNAME record to your DNS
   - **Email Validation**: Receive validation email

4. **DNS Validation Process**
   - ACM provides CNAME record details
   - Add this record to your domain's DNS settings
   - Wait for validation (usually 5-10 minutes)

5. **Certificate Issued**
   - Once validated, certificate status becomes "Issued"
   - Can now be used with AWS services

## Domain Setup with Load Balancer

### Complete Process:

1. **Get Load Balancer DNS Name**
   - After creating LB, copy the DNS name
   - Example: `my-app-lb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`

2. **Update DNS Records**
   - Go to your domain registrar or DNS provider
   - Create/update DNS record:
     - **Type**: CNAME (or A record with alias if using Route 53)
     - **Name**: Your subdomain (e.g., `app`)
     - **Value**: Load Balancer DNS name

3. **Attach Certificate to Load Balancer**
   - Edit HTTPS listener on load balancer
   - Select your ACM certificate
   - Save changes

### Example DNS Configuration:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: app
Value: my-app-lb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
TTL: 300
```

## Complete Flow

Here's how everything works together:

```
User visits app.yourdomain.com
           ‚Üì
DNS resolves to Load Balancer
           ‚Üì
Load Balancer receives request
           ‚Üì
HTTPS Listener checks SSL certificate (ACM)
           ‚Üì
Listener Rules determine routing
           ‚Üì
Request forwarded to Target Group
           ‚Üì
Target Group routes to healthy Target
           ‚Üì
Target (EC2 instance) processes request
           ‚Üì
Response sent back through same path
```

### Security Flow:
1. **SSL Termination**: Load Balancer handles SSL/TLS encryption using ACM certificate
2. **Security Groups**: Control traffic at LB and instance level
3. **Health Checks**: Ensure only healthy targets receive traffic

---


## Important Notes:
- Always use **at least 2 Availability Zones** for high availability
- **Health checks** are crucial - configure appropriate health check paths
- **Security groups** must allow traffic on listener ports
- **ACM certificates** are region-specific
- Use **Route 53** for better integration with AWS services

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Load Balancer Shows Unhealthy Targets:
- Check security groups on instances
- Verify health check path returns 200 OK
- Ensure application is running on correct port

### Certificate Not Working:
- Verify DNS validation is complete
- Check certificate is in same region as load balancer
- Ensure HTTPS listener is configured with certificate

### Domain Not Resolving:
- Verify DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
- Check DNS record configuration
- Use tools like `nslookup` or `dig` to verify
