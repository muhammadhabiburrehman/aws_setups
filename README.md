# AWS Setups

Welcome to my AWS learning repository! This is where I practice and implement various AWS services through hands-on projects and real-world scenarios.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- **Learning Documentation**: Practical implementations of AWS services
- **Reference Guide**: Code examples and configurations for future use
- **Practice Ground**: Hands-on experience with cloud computing
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Resources for anyone learning AWS

## 🛠️ What You'll Find

Each folder contains a complete implementation of an AWS service with:
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Working code examples
- Configuration files
- Documentation and best practices
- Troubleshooting guides
